# PURPOSE OF ANALYSIS
We are creating a website showing UFO sightings. Data is being pulled from a javascript file containing JSON object. User has the capability of filtering data based on different filter criterions on the page like city/state where the sighting occurred. 

## HOW TO USE THE SITE
The website is designed asethetically with dark background and light font. All the data filtering happens in the javascript making the website fairly fast.

Click on the navigation bar to clear out all the filters and return page containing the original unfiltered data.

Below are the criterions on which you can filter the data for your analysis. Each field gives you an idea of how to enter the data in order to get to the result. Eg: enter data in format "1/10/2010". After filling out the field, tab out and table data gets filterd based on the search term.
